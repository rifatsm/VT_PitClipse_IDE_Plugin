Feature: Code mutation analysis on refactored tests

  Scenario: Create a simple Java Project
    Given eclipse opens and the welcome screen is acknowledged
    And the java perspective is opened
    And an empty workspace
    When the user creates a project with name project3
    Then the project project3 exists in the workspace

  Scenario: Create a class that will be renamed later
    When a class NormaJean in package foo.bar.plebs is created in project project3
    Then package foo.bar.plebs exists in project project3
    And class NormaJean exists in package foo.bar.plebs in project project3
    When a class NormaJeanTest in package foo.bar.plebs is created in project project3
    Then class NormaJeanTest exists in package foo.bar.plebs in project project3
    Given the class NormaJeanTest in package foo.bar.plebs in project project3 is selected
    When a method "@Test public void njTestCase1() {org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(21, new NormaJean().doMyThing(1));}" is created
    Given the class NormaJean in package foo.bar.plebs in project project3 is selected
    When a method "public int doMyThing(int i) {return i + 20;}" is created
    When test NormaJeanTest in package foo.bar.plebs is run for project project3
    Then a coverage report is generated with 1 classes tested with overall coverage of 100% and mutation coverage of 100%
    When tests in package foo.bar.plebs are run for project project3
    Then a coverage report is generated with 1 classes tested with overall coverage of 100% and mutation coverage of 100%
    When tests in source root src are run for project project3
    Then a coverage report is generated with 1 classes tested with overall coverage of 100% and mutation coverage of 100%

  Scenario: Create another class
    When a class TrevorBrookes in package foo.bar.plebs is created in project project3
    Then package foo.bar.plebs exists in project project3
    And class TrevorBrookes exists in package foo.bar.plebs in project project3
    When a class TrevorBrookesTest in package foo.bar.plebs is created in project project3
    Then class TrevorBrookesTest exists in package foo.bar.plebs in project project3
    Given the class TrevorBrookesTest in package foo.bar.plebs in project project3 is selected
    When a method "@Test public void tbTestCase1() {org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(10, new TrevorBrookes().doMyThing(5));}" is created
    Given the class TrevorBrookes in package foo.bar.plebs in project project3 is selected
    When a method "public int doMyThing(int i) {return 2 * i;}" is created
    When test TrevorBrookesTest in package foo.bar.plebs is run for project project3
    Then a coverage report is generated with 2 classes tested with overall coverage of 50% and mutation coverage of 50%
    When tests in package foo.bar.plebs are run for project project3
    Then a coverage report is generated with 2 classes tested with overall coverage of 100% and mutation coverage of 100%
    When tests in source root src are run for project project3
    Then a coverage report is generated with 2 classes tested with overall coverage of 100% and mutation coverage of 100%

  Scenario: Rename a class
    Given the class NormaJean in package foo.bar.plebs in project project3 is selected
    When the class is renamed to MarilynMonroe
    Given the class NormaJeanTest in package foo.bar.plebs in project project3 is selected
    When the class is renamed to MarilynMonroeTest
    When test MarilynMonroeTest in package foo.bar.plebs is run for project project3
    Then a coverage report is generated with 2 classes tested with overall coverage of 50% and mutation coverage of 50%
    When tests in package foo.bar.plebs are run for project project3
    Then a coverage report is generated with 2 classes tested with overall coverage of 100% and mutation coverage of 100%
    When tests in source root src are run for project project3
    Then a coverage report is generated with 2 classes tested with overall coverage of 100% and mutation coverage of 100%

  Scenario: Rename the other class
    Given the class TrevorBrookes in package foo.bar.plebs in project project3 is selected
    When the class is renamed to BrunoBrookes
    Given the class TrevorBrookesTest in package foo.bar.plebs in project project3 is selected
    When the class is renamed to BrunoBrookesTest
    When test BrunoBrookesTest in package foo.bar.plebs is run for project project3
    Then a coverage report is generated with 2 classes tested with overall coverage of 50% and mutation coverage of 50%
    When tests in package foo.bar.plebs are run for project project3
    Then a coverage report is generated with 2 classes tested with overall coverage of 100% and mutation coverage of 100%
    When tests in source root src are run for project project3
    Then a coverage report is generated with 2 classes tested with overall coverage of 100% and mutation coverage of 100%

  Scenario: Rename the package
    Given the package foo.bar.plebs in project project3 is selected
    When the package is renamed to foo.bar.slebs
    When tests in package foo.bar.slebs are run for project project3
    Then a coverage report is generated with 2 classes tested with overall coverage of 100% and mutation coverage of 100%
    When tests in source root src are run for project project3
    Then a coverage report is generated with 2 classes tested with overall coverage of 100% and mutation coverage of 100%
    When test MarilynMonroeTest in package foo.bar.slebs is run for project project3
    Then a coverage report is generated with 2 classes tested with overall coverage of 50% and mutation coverage of 50%
    When test BrunoBrookesTest in package foo.bar.slebs is run for project project3
    Then a coverage report is generated with 2 classes tested with overall coverage of 50% and mutation coverage of 50%
